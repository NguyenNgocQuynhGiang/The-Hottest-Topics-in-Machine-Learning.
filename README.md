1. Overview

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing research papers from the NIPS (Neural Information Processing Systems) conference. The NIPS conference is a prominent event in the machine learning community, featuring a wide range of papers on various machine learning topics. This README provides an overview of the analysis process and how to use the code provided.

2. Contents

2.1 Loading the NIPS papers: Explains how the dataset was obtained and provides code to load and explore the data.

2.2 Preparing the data for analysis: Describes the data preprocessing steps to focus on text data and remove unnecessary columns.

2.3 Plotting how machine learning has evolved over time: Visualizes the number of NIPS papers published each year to understand the growth of the field.

2.4 Preprocessing the text data: Preprocesses the titles of the research papers for further analysis.
A word cloud to visualize the preprocessed text data: Uses word cloud visualization to understand the most common words in the paper titles.

2. 5 Prepare the text for LDA analysis: Prepares the text data for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis, a topic modeling technique.
   
2.6 Analyzing trends with LDA: Applies LDA to identify topics in the research paper titles and explores the most prominent themes.

4. Usage
   
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.
